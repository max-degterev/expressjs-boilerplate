# ExpressJS Boilerplate

ExpressJS boilerplate with React SPA frontend. CoffeeScript, CJSX, Redux and React Router. Built-in server side React rendering.

## Usage:
### Development:

1. Install NodeJS:

  It is recommended to install NodeJS with a native installer via [NodeJS.org website](http://nodejs.org/download/).

  If you prefer using Homebrew (`brew install node`), it will break your NPM installation. Here's a [fix](https://gist.github.com/DanHerbert/9520689).

2. Install dependencies:

  `npm install`

3. Start server:

  `npm start`

  and navigate your browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
